    # General push notification interface to abstract from details of different
    # push notification services, e.g. Apple Push Notification Service or
    # Google Cloud to Device Messaging Framework for Android.
    #
    # An instance of this class represents a logical push notification that may
    # be sent to different users. The notifications will be sent to all devices
    # registered with these users.
    #
    # Usage:
    # Create a new instance using #new, set the payload and recipients, and
    # invoke #send to send the notifications to all recipients.
    # It is possible to adjust the notification for each device (see #adjust_payload).
